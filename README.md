# Rummikub
## How to play
Max 5 players.
Each player will draw 14 tiles from the table, placing them on their rack; whatever is left forms the pool. 
On the first turn, each player will in turns attempt to make a set of one or more groups or runs that adds up to at least 30 points.

A group is formed when three or four tiles of the same numbers are put together; like suits in a deck of cards, each number will have a different color. 
A run is formed when three or more numbers of the same color are played together. Playing a group or a run makes a set (sometimes called a meld). 
So on your first turn, you must lay either groups or runs that add up to at least 30 points. 
If your tiles aren't cooperating, no worries: You can take a tile from the pool in the hopes it'll help you snag a 30-point set to get you in the game. 
You can't play the drawn tile until the next turn, however — this goes for any tile drawn during the game.

From there, it's your job on every turn to scope out places where your tiles can add to a run or a group. This is called melding. A few ways to meld:

    Add a tile to an existing run or group.
    Take the fourth tile from a run or group to complete your own set or add a fourth to another group and take another tile to create a new set.
    Split a run. For instance, a run of 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 is on the table. You take a six from your rack and create a 4, 5, 6 run and make the remaining 6, 7, 8 its own run.

The object of the game is to place all your tiles on the table as part of a set. Once someone does that, that person can proclaim "Rummikub" and is the game's winner. 

The two joker tiles are used in Rummikub much like they are in any card game; play them as any tile. 
But beware: Another player can pick up the joker if he or she has the specific tile it's replacing. 
And — even worse — you'll have to add a penalty of 30 points to your score if it's left on your rack at the end of the game.
